easysetup
=========

*easysetup* helps creating a package distribution setup for Windows users.

**Features:**

* Easy to use, just run easysetup from your application setup directory.
* All setup configuration is in one file (appinfo.py).
* It creates templates for Travis, Shippable and tox.
* It creates a template for development requirements.
* It creates an empty template for installation requirements.
* It creates a template for git VCS exceptions.
* It creates a template for files to be included in the setup.
* It creates a template for a README file.
* It creates a template for wheel setup and Sphinx documentation upload.
* It can create template files in the doc directory (assumes use of Sphinx 1.3.1+ and that the sphinx-quickstart command was already executed).
* It can create an updated reference.rst in the doc directory (assumes previous item).

After running easysetup, you can find a build.cmd in the current directory that should be run to build your application (check the comments inside the file for usage).
When running easysetup without options, if there are any files on the current directory, they are moved to a _bak directory.
